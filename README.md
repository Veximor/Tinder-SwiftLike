# Tinder-SwiftLike

## Description
This userscript automatically likes profiles on Tinder. By enabling the auto-like switch, the script will periodically click the "like" button on Tinder profiles. It also provides a small interface to toggle the auto-like feature on and off, directly on the Tinder webpage.

## Features
- **Auto Like**: Automatically click the like button on Tinder profiles.
- **Mute Audio**: Mutes audio elements on the Tinder page to prevent unexpected noise.
- **Close Super Like Dialog**: Automatically closes the Super Like dialog if it appears.
- **Remove Selfie Verification Menu**: Removes selfie verification prompts.
- **Remove Annoying Menu**: Removes unwanted menus or dialogs that may obstruct user interaction.

## How to Use
1. **Install the userscript** using a browser extension that supports userscripts (e.g., Tampermonkey).
2. **Navigate to Tinder**: Open your browser and navigate to Tinder's website.
3. **Enable Auto Like**: Click on the "Auto Like" switch that appears in the top left corner of the page. When enabled, the switch will turn green, and the script will begin automatically liking profiles. To disable auto-like, simply click the switch again.

## Customization
- The auto-like interval is customizable. By default, the script likes a profile every 100 milliseconds.
- Users can move the "Auto Like Menu" to a convenient location on the page. The position will be remembered between browser sessions.
